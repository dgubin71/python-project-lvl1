 Clone the repository <https://github.com/dgubin71/python-project-lvl1>  to the project directory and execute  next command:  
 


    $ make install           create environment variables and dependencies
    $ make build             create build package

 The package contain 5 games. For start games use commands:  
 
    $ brain-even             Even or odd
    $ brain-calc             Ð¡alculator
    $ brain-gcd              Find the greatest common divisor 
    $ brain-progression      Find number wich is missing in the progression
    $ brain-prime            Prime number or not

### Game  "Even or Odd"
You are shown a random number. And you need to answer "yes" if the number is even, or "no" if it's odd.

The game is started by the command:
